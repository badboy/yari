title: Sectioning headers
slug: Web/Sectioning_headers

This page has `h2` and `h3` tags that do NOT site at the root.
That's a flaw, and this page exists to prove that it gets caught as a `sectioning`
flaw when built.

## First

The builder is able to cope OK if the `h2` is the only
one at this level. But the problem is going to be this next one...

## Second

Note that the ^ above-mentioned `h2` isn't treated
as a heading that appears in the TOC. Only the first one is.
