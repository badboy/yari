A **Bézier curve** (pronounced \[bezje]) is a mathematically described curve used in computer graphics and animation. In {{Glossary("vector image", "vector images")}}, they are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.

What's so special about this page is that it's got a non-ascii character in the directory name and the slug.
